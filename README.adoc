== Repository Infrastructure

The following infrastructure is in place:

=== Multi-Forge Mirroring

Automatic synchronization to:

* GitLab (`gitlab.com/hyperpolymath`)
* Codeberg (`codeberg.org/hyperpolymath`)
* Bitbucket (`bitbucket.org/hyperpolymath`)

Controlled via repository variables:

* `GITLAB_MIRROR_ENABLED`
* `CODEBERG_MIRROR_ENABLED`
* `BITBUCKET_MIRROR_ENABLED`

=== Instant Sync

Push and release events trigger propagation across all forges via the `.git-private-farm` dispatch system.

=== Security Policy

See link:SECURITY.md[SECURITY.md] for:

* Vulnerability reporting procedures
* Response timelines
* CI/CD security measures
* Required repository settings

== Development Standards

This project follows the *Hyperpolymath Language Policy* (see `.claude/CLAUDE.md`):
